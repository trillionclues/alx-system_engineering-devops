<h1>System Engineering Devops - Shell Permissions, Redirections and Variable Expansions</h1>
</break>

<p>This repository contains programs written for the system engineering devops track at ALX, Holberton school. In this projects, I worked on shell scripting basics, shell permissions and also practiced on variable expansions. I learned about Linux file permissions, shell commands, difference between local, global and reserved variable, arithmetic operations with the shell and how to redirect standard output to a file. The specific list of projects is contained as follows:</p>
